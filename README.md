# apsl-lang
**Algebraic Proof System Language**

A language written in rust to generate proofs of algebraic statements, based on algebraic structures.

# Installation

Clone and cd into the repo :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Nicolas-Reyland/apsl-lang.git
cd apsl-lang
```

Install rust and cargo, then run :
```sh
cargo build --release
```

# Usage
To get a repl shell, run :

```sh
cargo run --release
```

You can also import *apsl* files by adding them to the `cargo run` command like so : `cargo run file1.apsl file2.apsl ...` .

Once inside the repl-shell, you can type `help` to get some more infos about the available commands.

# Examples

## Basics
Let's write a file with the following rules/axioms, defining an algebraic structure with one operation `+` :
```
+ :: {
  A + B = B + A ;
  (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) ;
}
```
Let's call that file *plus.apsl*.

Now, let's start a repl (`cargo run plus.apsl`). You can also just run `cargo run`, then use the `import` command as such: `import plus.apsl`.
To check that the rules are well loaded, type `ctx`. This should give you the following output :
```
 Properties :
 | A + B = B + A
 | (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)

```

Now that the rules defining our `+` operation are loaded, you can ask for a prove of `A + B + C = C + B + A` with the following command : `prove A + B + C = C + B + A`. That should give you the following result :

```
 Solution found for 'X + Y + Z = Z + Y + X' :
  (X + Y) + Z
 = Z + (X + Y)		|	A + B = B + A
 = Z + (Y + X)		|	A + B = B + A
 = Z + Y + X		|	(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
```

## Bit more tricky case
Now that we've proven that **A + B + C = C + B + A** (wow üò≤), let's prove that **(X + Y)^2 = (X^2) + (2\*X\*Y) + (Y^2)** ! (I bet you didn't know that was a thing in maths, ey ? üòè)

Note that in these expressions, we have to use parentheses, because no order has been established between the `+`and `*`operations (none will be established in this example). To prove this, we'll need our custom rules defining our `+` and `*` operations, which are in the `examples/numbers.apsl`.

We can start a repl with `cargo run examples/numbers.apsl`, and make sure we have all the rule we need :

If you dont't want to start a new shell, you can do the following :
```
Algebraic Proof System Language „Äâctx clear
 Cleared context

Algebraic Proof System Language „Äâctx
 No Properties

Algebraic Proof System Language „Äâimport examples/numbers.apsl
 imported 'examples/numbers.apsl'

```
Let's check the current context.
```
Algebraic Proof System Language „Äâctx
 Properties :
 | A + B = B + A
 | (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
 | A + 0 = A
 | A * B = B * A
 | (A * B) * C = A * (B * C)
 | A * 1 = A
 | A * 0 = 0
 | A ^ 0 = 1
 | A ^ 1 = A
 | A * (B + C) = (A * B) + (A * C)
 | A * 2 = A + A
 | A ^ 2 = A * A

 K Properties :
 | K :: R1

 Auto break : true

Finally, let's ask it to prove the equality :
```
Algebraic Proof System Language „Äâprove (X + Y)^2 = (X*X) + (2 * (X * Y)) + (Y*Y)
```
Which gives us a proof, using the rules we have defined :
```
 Solution found for '(X + Y) ^ 2 = (X ^ 2) + (2 * X * Y) + (Y ^ 2)' :
  (X + Y) ^ 2
 = (X + Y) * (X + Y)					|	A ^ 2 = A * A
 = ((X + Y) * X) + ((X + Y) * Y)			|	A * (B + C) = (A * B) + (A * C)
 = (X * (X + Y)) + ((X + Y) * Y)			|	A * B = B * A
 = (X * X) + (X * Y) + ((X + Y) * Y)			|	A * (B + C) = (A * B) + (A * C)
 = (X * X) + (X * Y) + (Y * (X + Y))			|	A * B = B * A
 = (X * X) + (X * Y) + ((Y * X) + (Y * Y))		|	A * (B + C) = (A * B) + (A * C)
 = (X * X) + (X * Y) + ((X * Y) + (Y * Y))		|	A * B = B * A
 = (X * X) + (X * Y) + ((X * Y) + (Y ^ 2))		|	A ^ 2 = A * A
 = (X * X) + (X * Y) + (X * Y) + (Y ^ 2)		|	(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
 = (X ^ 2) + (X * Y) + (X * Y) + (Y ^ 2)		|	A ^ 2 = A * A
 = (X ^ 2) + ((X * Y) + (X * Y)) + (Y ^ 2)		|	(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
 = (X ^ 2) + (X * Y * 2) + (Y ^ 2)			|	A * 2 = A + A
 = (X ^ 2) + (2 * (X * Y)) + (Y ^ 2)			|	A * B = B * A
 = (X ^ 2) + (2 * X * Y) + (Y ^ 2)			|	(A * B) * C = A * (B * C)
```
You may notice that some parentheses are missing for the rule on the right to be applied.
This is because the expressions on the left are *pretty-printed*. To disable this behaviour, you should
execute :
