Todo List :
- optimize everything
- write new parsing tests (once new grammar is worked out)
- only iterate over  graph "outer layer" (doesn't seem to work somehow)
- reverse-match simple expressions to sequential expressions
  e.g. "A * A * A" matched to "# * : N : A #"
- atom values can be more than one char long
- add real operator priority, where "2 * A + 3" would be legal
  and would be translated to "(2 * A) + 3" if '*' happened to have a higher
  priority than '+'
- ability to re-print last proof (after settings expr-pretty-print <action>)
