Todo List :
- optimize everything
- different parsers for generators (separate start & end)
- use more references, less copies of data (for threads etc)
- memoization
- write new parsing tests
- only iterate over  graph "outer layer" (doesn't seem to work somehow)
- re-implement generators using a two-argument function
- atom values can be more than one char long
- remove duplicates of algebraic objects when adding to context
- maybe add an operator associativity that is both left and right ?
