Todo List :
- general: optimize everything
- tests: write new parsing tests (once new grammar is worked out)
- solution: only iterate over  graph "outer layer" (doesn't seem to work somehow)
- parser: atom symbols can be longer than one char
- parser: add real operator priority, where "2 * A + 3" would be legal
  and would be translated to "(2 * A) + 3" if '*' happened to have a higher
  priority than '+'
- repl: ability to re-print last proof (after settings expr-pretty-print <action>)
- exploration: maximum number of threads allowed
  currently, all threads for property-matching are started at the same time, then are
  all joined at the end.
  there should be a loop, only allowing N max threads to run, adding and joining.
