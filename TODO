Todo List :
- optimize everything
- write new parsing tests
- only iterate over  graph "outer layer" (doesn't seem to work somehow)
- re-implement generators somehow
- atom values can be more than one char long
- add real operator priority, where "2 * A + 3" would be legal
- ability to re-print last proof (after settings expr-pretty-print <action>)
